### Explore US Bikeshare Data

Project 2 of Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree explored data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and Python script was used to compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Datasets
The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
*Start Time

*End Time

*Trip Duration (in seconds)

*Start station

*End station

*User type

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:

*Gender

*Birth Year

### Questions Explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

1. What is the most popular month for start time?

2. What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?

3. What is the most popular hour of day for start time?

4. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?

5. What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?

6. What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?

7. What are the counts of gender?

8. What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
